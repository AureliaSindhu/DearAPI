### A Valentine's Day Letter Generator for Backend Developers
### Created to help backend devs (and others) impress their special someone on Valentine's Day!
<br> </br> 
### How It Works
- Input Section: The user enters the content theyâ€™d like to include in the letter, such as a message or any personalized text.
- Generation: Once the content is submitted, the application takes the input and renders it in a beautifully styled letter format.
- Review and Send: The user can then review the letter, make any adjustments, and send it to their SO directly through the platform or copy it for later use.
